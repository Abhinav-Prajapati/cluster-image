Of course. Based on the application you're building‚Äîan image gallery with a powerful batch clustering dashboard‚ÄîI know exactly what you're making. It's an interactive data analysis and curation tool.

Here are the 15 most essential features I'd suggest implementing next to elevate it from a great tool to an indispensable one, grouped by priority.

### ## Foundational & Core Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è

These are the most critical features for making the application robust and usable for real-world tasks.

1.  **Asynchronous Analysis Tasks:** Your biggest technical hurdle will be long-running analyses. Right now, a large batch will time out the request. You need a backend task queue (like **Celery** with **Redis** or **RabbitMQ**) to run the clustering in the background. The frontend would start the job and then poll for status updates or receive them via WebSockets.

2.  **Full Batch Management (CRUD):** You can create and read batches, but you also need to be able to **Rename** and **Delete** them from the `/batches` page. These are fundamental data management operations.

3.  **View Outliers / Noise Cluster:** Any good clustering algorithm produces outliers (images that don't belong to any group, often labeled as cluster "-1"). You need a dedicated section in the analysis view to show these images. Without this, the user is missing a critical part of the analysis result.

4.  **Save Analysis Results:** Currently, changing a parameter re-runs the analysis. You should allow users to "save" a specific set of results (the parameters used and the resulting clusters). This would let them create multiple analyses for a single batch and compare them.

5.  **System-Wide Image Deletion:** The user needs a way to permanently delete an image from the entire application, not just remove it from a batch. This is crucial for managing the image library.

### ## User Experience & Workflow Enhancements ‚ú®

These features will dramatically improve how it feels to use the app, making complex tasks faster and more intuitive.

6.  **Image Lightbox / Full-Screen Viewer:** Users need to see a larger version of an image to make decisions. Clicking a thumbnail anywhere in the app should open a "lightbox" view where they can see the full-resolution image and maybe cycle through others in the same cluster.

7.  **Bulk Selection Tools:** In the gallery and cluster views, add "Select All," "Deselect All," and **Shift + Click** functionality to select a range of images at once. This is a massive time-saver for managing large batches.

8.  **Pagination:** The main `/` gallery and the "Add Images" modal will become slow once you have thousands of images. Adding pagination (loading images in chunks of 50 or 100) is essential for performance.

9.  **Drag-and-Drop Uploads:** Enhance the upload form on the main gallery page to accept files dragged directly from the user's desktop.

10. **Search & Filter Main Gallery:** Add a search bar to the main gallery to find images by filename. Later, you could add filtering by date, size, or tags.

### ## Advanced Analysis & Interaction üî¨

These features transform the dashboard from a simple viewer into a powerful, interactive analysis tool.

11. **Label/Rename Clusters:** Let the user rename "Cluster 1" to something meaningful, like "Sunset Photos" or "Defective Products." This is key to turning raw data into useful, human-readable information.

12. **Move Images Between Clusters:** Give the user the power to correct the algorithm. Let them select one or more images in one cluster and move them to another (or move them into a new cluster). This is a core feature for data curation.

13. **Export Batch Results:** Provide a button to download the analysis results as a **CSV** file. The file should contain columns like `image_filename` and `cluster_id`, allowing users to use the data elsewhere.

14. **User Authentication:** To make this a truly useful application for teams or multiple projects, you'll need a simple user login system so that different users can manage their own images and batches privately.

15. **2D Cluster Visualization:** This is the ultimate feature for this app. Use a dimensionality reduction technique like **t-SNE** or **PCA** on the backend to give each image a 2D coordinate based on its features. Then, use a frontend library (like `d3.js` or `chart.js`) to display all the images in the batch as a scatter plot, colored by their cluster. This gives the user an immediate, intuitive understanding of the data's structure.
